Path fixer: a gem plugin that ensures that all binaries from gems
are symlinked to /usr/local/bin
----------------------------------------------------------------------

Each time you install/remove gem this plugin will synchronize
/usr/local/bin symlinks with rubygems bin directory. So it works 100%
automagically.

This fixes known issue with rubygems on Debian & Ubuntu which install
gem binaries to /var/lib/gems/1.{8,9}/bin. And that directory is not
in default PATH.
